CONTROLLER V2 IDEAS

1. Eliminate on-off switch or put inline into power cable

2. Combine valve and CAN bus connectors into a single large connector with an external wiring harness. Make sure to have spare pins so future boards can do more stuff but wiring can be backwards compatible

3. Integrate IMU

4. Add GPIO for microswitches to single large connector.

5. Add 10 ground connections via screw terminal blocks.

6. Eliminate USB.

7. Integrate UDP adapter into board

8. Make modular so small carrier boards for RTK that plug together?

9. Modular carrier board for Cytron?

10. Put BNC connectors on modular carrier boards with short, impedance matched traces to board-mounted SMA connectors
